PROCESS_MIX_OF_ITEMS CHALLENGE
------------------------------
Folder has four subfolder each exploring an approach 
to solve the problem
Subdirectories of Interest are:
./unionApproach
./itemWrapperApproach
./inheritenceApproach
./chameleonApproach

Each folder contains a makefile
to run in linux:
$>make clean
$>make

to use VSC++:
please load the folder as a project in VSC++ and 
build/generate appropriate proj and sln files


./givenSourceCode-contains documents/code given for the 
challenge

./Docs-contains design document "writeup.pdf" which explains
the design decisions taken in this challenge alongside
explaining the pros and cons of each approach

./SupportDocs-contains all class diagrams,writeup lyx files

ASSUMPTIONS:
The part of the given source code where a prompt waits for
user to end the program is assumed to be used for interaction
and is not included in the design challenge.

The solution approaches focus on designing and implementing a 
heterogenous container involving Object Oriented design principles.
